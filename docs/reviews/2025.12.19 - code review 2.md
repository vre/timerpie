⏺ Code Review Complete

  The code-reviewer agent thoroughly reviewed the TaskTimer codebase. Here's the summary:

  Overall Assessment: Ready for production ✓

  The codebase demonstrates solid engineering with excellent test coverage (280 tests passing), proper separation of concerns following AGENTS.md architecture, and good security practices.

  Strengths

  - Architecture - Clean separation: ClockLogic has pure functions, state object holds mutable state, el caches DOM refs
  - Testing - Comprehensive: unit tests, integration tests, security tests, regression tests, canvas rendering tests
  - Security - Input validation, cookie SameSite=Lax, URL hash parameter allowlist
  - Accessibility - ARIA attributes, screen reader status region, focus-visible styles

  Recommendations

  1. Add URL.revokeObjectURL() after worker creation
  2. Add :focus-visible to tooltip CSS alongside :hover
  3. Create CHANGELOG.md as required by AGENTS.md
  4. Match PiP render rate to capture rate (both 30fps)

Findings

Important – Plan deviation: The plan calls for tests to “load from src/” (see 2025-12-19-dev-release-split-design.md), but current tests still read the built TaskTimer.html via createDOM() in clock.test.js. This means failures in the dev HTML/CSS/JS split (e.g., missing assets in src) might be hidden by a previously built artifact. Consider pointing tests at index.html (or building in-memory from src files) to align with the plan and catch source regressions earlier.
Important – Input validation gap: In ClockLogic.parseInput the hh:mm branch accepts empty segments (e.g., “:” or “:5”), treating them as 0 and starting a capped timer instead of rejecting. That allows malformed input to launch a timer silently. Tighten validation to require both hour and minute digits (e.g., regex like /^\d{1,2}:\d{2}$/) in clock-logic.js.
Suggestion – Fragile build stripping: build.js removes dev <link>/<script> tags with newline-sensitive, single-match regexes. Minor formatting changes in index.html (extra spaces, different line breaks) could leave external assets in the release bundle. A DOM-based removal (e.g., parse HTML and drop nodes by tag/src) would make the build step more robust.
Suggestion – Startup cost: The beep data URI is generated eagerly on load in app.js even when sound is off by default. That does Base64 work (~66 KB) every page load and in tests. Lazy-generate only when sound is enabled or on first alarm to reduce startup work.
Well done: Strong separation of pure logic vs. UI, extensive JSDOM coverage including accessibility/tooling behaviors, and careful cookie/hash sanitization.

1. Plan Alignment Analysis
File Split Implementation: The separation of TaskTimer.html into src components (index.html, style.css, app.js, clock-logic.js) has been implemented correctly and matches the file structure in the plan.
Build Script: The build.js script correctly assembles the release file by injecting the external resources, fulfilling the core requirement.
Test Strategy Deviation: The plan stated "Update clock.test.js to load from src", but the implementation continues to load the built TaskTimer.html (via a pretest build step).
Assessment: This is a justified deviation. Testing the generated artifact (TaskTimer.html) ensures the release build is valid and self-contained. However, it adds a build step to every test run.
2. Code Quality Assessment
Inconsistent JavaScript Standards (Important):
clock-logic.js uses ES5 syntax (var, no const/let), likely adhering to the CHANGELOG item #30 "FIX: ES5 compatibility".
app.js uses ES6+ syntax (const, let) extensively.
Recommendation: Clarify if ES5 compatibility is still a hard requirement. If yes, app.js must be refactored to use var. If no, clock-logic.js should be updated to const/let for consistency.
Global Namespace: ClockLogic and state are declared in the global scope. While acceptable for this specific single-file architecture, it relies on implicit ordering (logic before app).
Worker Implementation: The inline Worker blob in app.js is a clever solution for the single-file requirement and is implemented correctly with a fallback.
3. Architecture and Design Review
Separation of Concerns: The split between ClockLogic (pure functions) and app.js (UI/State) is excellent. It makes the logic easier to test and maintain.
Build Process: The regex-based build script is simple and effective for this specific use case. It avoids heavy bundler dependencies, keeping the project lightweight.
4. Documentation and Standards
Project Structure: AGENTS.md has been updated to reflect the new structure.
Changelog: The CHANGELOG.md is up to date.
5. Issues and Recommendations
Severity	Issue	Recommendation
Important	Inconsistent JS Syntax (ES5 vs ES6)	Decide on a target JS version. If ES5 is required (as per Changelog #30), refactor app.js to remove const/let.
Suggestion	Test Target	Consider adding a test mode that runs against index.html directly for faster dev cycles, while keeping the artifact test for CI/pre-release.
Suggestion	Variable Declarations	app.js declares var timerWorker but uses const elsewhere. Standardize on let/const if ES6 is allowed.
Summary:
The refactoring to a split development structure is a significant improvement for maintainability. The build process is solid. The main point to address is the inconsistency in JavaScript versions, which contradicts the previously stated ES5 compatibility goal.
