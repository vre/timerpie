⏺ Code Review Summary

  Critical Issues (2)

  1. Timer completion race condition - Web Worker and animation loop can both trigger completion, causing double alarms
  2. END mode hour rollover bug - Time comparison fails when crossing hour boundary (e.g., end time 59 mins, current time 2 mins)

  High Priority (1)

  3. Cookie value length not validated - Could exceed 4KB browser limit

  Medium Priority (2)

  4. Tooltips not keyboard accessible - CSS :hover only, need :focus-visible
  5. Worker blob URL never revoked - Minor memory leak

  Low Priority (3)

  6. PiP rendering at 60fps but streaming at 30fps - CPU waste
  7. Pause state not announced to screen readers
  8. Dynamic theme-color meta tag - Could update with selected color
